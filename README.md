# AMATH 482 Computational Methods for Data Analysis
Homeworks I have done for this class, including codes(MATLAB/ Python) and reports

- HW1: Analyze Singular Value Decomposition on Yale's Eigenfaces dataset
- HW2: Principle Component Analysis on multiple cameras capturing the same object's oscillatory dynamics from different angles, including an algorithm to extract the location of the paint can.
- HW3: Machine Learning/ Classification of Music Genres
- HW4: Dynamic Mode Decomposition to separate foreground and background in a video
- HW5: Neural Network
